# Description
This was the third and final project for my university course, Object-oriented Programming with Java (CSCI 3381). The parameters for the assignment were intentionally vague so that each of us students could create something unique to himself. Basically, the only parameters for this assignment was to create a mock Netflix website that utilized the Java classes we wrote for project 1 (project 3 built upon project 1).

The two classes we had programmed for this were a single entity class and a collection class (that held many of these single entity objects). For example, each object of the single entity class is a Netflix entry.

Both the frontend and backend for this Netflix website have been successfully implemented. However I've worked substantially more on its backend because in general, functionality is what I tend to prioritize. So, the frontend looks rather... bland. However, it's still serviceable for demonstration purposes.

# Major Features
- A login page that asks for a username and password. Also has input validation for both.
- Can swap between "user mode" and "developer mode" and logout at any location in the site.
- Can specify English or Non-English films or tv series when asking for a Netflix recommendation.
- Has input validation when inputting invalid movie information (movie entries can be added through the developer mode).
- Can mark a movie as purged or unpurged in developer mode.

# Website Demonstration Video
For the project, we had to record a demonstration video. [This](https://youtu.be/otsAKrV3cUw) is that video. I use the program, showing off its major features that I chose to implement. In addition, I go over notable parts of the code that I'm especially proud of.

If you have any issues playing the video, please contact me at cholbrook582@gmail.com, and I'll help you out the best I can.

# Additional Details

This website is a rather baseline implementation, as it was just an assignment. However, I'm proud of how this project turned out because of how much I learned and how well my efforts paid off. I acknowledge that this website has improvements to be made; no matter what you program, there are always improvements to be made.

This website was programmed and tested for Apache Tomcat v9.0.
